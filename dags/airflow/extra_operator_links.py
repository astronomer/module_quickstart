### Module - Airflow Extra Links for Operators

<aside>
ðŸ“š Airflow includes plugins for customizing the Airflow UI. One small but impactful customization is adding extra links in theÂ **Details** view for operators in the UI. These extra links can point to static websites, such as documentation for the operator, or dynamic links created from information during the task instance run.
